## About

<b>Antifreeze proteins (AFPs)</b> or ice structuring proteins (ISPs) refer to a class of polypeptides produced by certain vertebrates, plants, fungi, bacteria and fish that permit their survival in subzero environments — through evolution as a natural survival response to the freezing cold. They help prevent the formation of ice crystals that damage cells. Organisms that have these proteins can live in extreme environments and are therefore known as ‘extremophiles’.

AFPDB<sup>®</sup>, is a dedicated computational biology database for Antifreeze Proteins — that covers, it's protein sequence, structure and genes that encodes these. Also, genetic networks of all the antifreeze proteins.
